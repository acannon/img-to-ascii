# img-to-ascii
Turns an image into ASCII art

Change Line #5 to specify new image.

This application transforms each pixel into a brightness value. It then converts these brightness values into ASCII characters and writes them to a new matrix. The matrix is then printed on the screen.

Completed with the assitance of https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/12/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-ascii-art/

Future refinement: Refine brightness algorithm to increase contrast and deliver a clearer ASCII image. Possibly extend to include color and to accept user input of file and other options.
